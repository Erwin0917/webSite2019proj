		<AboutMeStyles>
			I began creating my first websites at a school age. Then I have also studied graphics, UX and CMS. With
			several breaks I have worked as a graphic / web developer freelancer with a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS
			and, Wordpress. Around the year of 2016, I have decided to become genuinely interested in working as a
			frontend developer. Since then, I have been constantly improving my skills. At present, I am fluent in
			HTML, CSS(SASS), JavaScript, TypeScript and I also use such technologies as React, Redux, MobX, RestAPI,
			AJAX, etc. Currently, I devote most of my time to learn Node.js and about databases(SQL and noSQL). I
			hope, I will be able to call myself a fullstack developer in the near future.
