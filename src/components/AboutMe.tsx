		<AboutMeStyles>
			I've been created my first websites at school age. Then I've studied graphics, UX and CMS as well. With
			several breaks I've worked as graphic / web developer freelancer with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and
			Wordpress. Around 2016 I've decided really interested of work as frontend developer. Since than, I've
			been constantly improving my skills. At present I am fluent in HTML, CSS(SASS), JavaScript, TypeScript
			and use such technologies like React, Redux, MobX, RestAPI, AJAX, etc. Currently I devote most of my
			time to learn node.js and about databases(SQL and noSQL). I hope, I will be able to call mysefl
			fullstack developer in near future.
